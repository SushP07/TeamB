# TeamB
1) You all need to make your separate branches from the main branch with your respective names
2) Clone the files from your respective branches on your system.
3) Make necessary changes to your respective files assigned to you. (For ex: index.html, index3.html etc.) 
4) After making changes, add and commit those changes into your respective branch and generate a push request.

Your work is done! Now I will merge all the branches with the main branch. Now I can submit this branch as our final submission.
